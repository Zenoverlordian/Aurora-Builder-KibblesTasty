        <description>
            <p>A Cursesmith's power is invariably marked by the dark decisions they've made; some ignore this lingering darkness, pursuing the heights of power their reckless creation allows. Others leverage the twisted side effects themselves, believing there are no mistakes, only opportunities. Darker still are those that truly embrace the darkness of their twisted creations, becoming twisted creations themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Cursesmith is not always evil, but they walk a path that dangles precariously over evil, making it an easy thing to fall into. They may be Lawful, but the laws they respect are rarely those of normal mortal society that might get in the way of their dark delving.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, you set yourself apart from other Inventors by seizing power that others dare not wield. You partake a dark ritual investing enormous power into an melee weapon and intertwining it with your very soul, bestowing it with great power, but twisting and corrupting it. The weapon becomes permenantly bound to you. You have proficiency with the weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you perform the rite, select two of the following of the following upgrades: Empowered Artifact, Abhorrent Life, Grasping Form, Twisting Reach, Necrotic Wounding, or Eldritch Eruption. You can select additional properties as Upgrades, but your Forbidden Artifact can have a maximum number of these Upgrades equal to your proficiency bonus (meaning the first time you can select an additional property is 5th level).</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can awaken the weapon, invoking the awakened power and the cursed property until you suppress it again. You can suppress it as a bonus action, but if it has been awakened for more than 1 minute, you must pass a DC 10 Charisma save to return its dormant state.</p>
            <h5>EMPOWERED ARTIFACT</h5>
            <p>The weapon hums with great power. Once per turn, you can reroll one of the weapon’s damage dice. When attacking objects or structures, you can instead maximize its die.</p>
            <h5>ABHORRENT LIFE</h5>
            <p>Your Forbidden Artifact takes a life of its own, writhing and lashing on its own at your mental direction. You can apply your Intelligence modifier to the to attack and damage roll of the weapon where you usually apply your Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p>
            <h5>GRASPING FORM</h5>
            <p>You Forbidden Artifact can twist around binding targets. When you hit an attack with it, you can attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action. If you have the Abhorrent Life property, you can make an Intelligence (Athletics) check to initiate or contest the grapple. You cannot attack other creatures while grappling a creature with this weapon.</p>
            <h5>TWISTING REACH</h5>
            <p>Your Forbidden Artifact stretches and flexes unnaturally in seeking its targets. It’s range increases by 5 feet.</p>
            <h5>NECROTIC ROT</h5>
            <p>When awakened, the weapon is enshrouded in dark energy. Each time you hit a creature with it, it inflicts a stack of necrotic rot on the creature. At the end of a creature's turn it takes a 1d4 damage per stack of necrotic rot on it and makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the stacks on removed. On a failure, they remain. You can have a maximum number of stacks on a creature equal to your proficiency modifier.</p>
            <h5>ELDRITCH ERUPTION</h5>
            <p>You can release magical blasts of power from the weapon that deal damage equal to the weapons damage dice. Select from cold, fire, lightning or necrotic for its damage type when you select this upgrade. In place of making an attack with this weapon, you can release this energy as a ranged spell attack. The ranged spell attack has a range of 60 feet. You can apply your Intelligence modifier to damage done with this attack.</p>

            <p>So long ago you forged great power. Now you realize its full potential. Your cursed weapon becomes a true artifact, any bonus to attack and damage rolls lower than +3 it has is replaced by a bonus of +3, it gains two additional properties from the following list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>While attuned to this artifact, you are immune to disease.</li>
                <li>While attuned to this artifact, you can't be charmed or frightened.</li>
                <li>While attuned to this artifact, you can cast a 1st or 2nd level spell of your choice once per short rest without expended a spell slot (spell chosen when this upgrade is selected).</li>
                <li>While attuned to this artifact, you can treat a 1 on a Death Saving throw as a 20.</li>
                <li>While attuned to this artifact, one of your ability scores (chosen when this upgrade is selected) increases by 1, to a maximum of 24.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">When you select this upgrade, you can a select the condition in which your weapon can be destroyed. Your weapon can no longer be permanently destroyed by any other means. This means can be absurd or implausible, but must be something potentially possible.</p>
