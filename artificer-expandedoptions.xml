            <p>You attempt to bind a creatures soul to a doll, linking the creature to the doll in a sympathetic link. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On failure, the creature becomes bound to the doll. On a successful save, the creature is not bound and the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">As part of casting the spell when the creature fails the save, and on subsequent turns using your action until the spell ends, you can perform one of the following actions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold the doll still, causing the creature to be Restrained until start of your next turn.</li>
                <li>Force the doll to move, causing the creature to move 15 feet in a direction of your choice that it can move.</li>
                <li>Smash the doll, causing it take 4d6 bludgeoning damage.</li>
                <li>Rip the doll in half, ending the spell, destroying the doll, and dealing 4d12 necrotic damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Each time after the first you use an action to manipulate the doll, after the effect takes place, the creature can repeat the Charisma with disadvantage, ending the effect on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once a creature has been targeted by this spell, they cannot be targeted again for 24 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When cast with a 5th level spell slot or above, the range of the spell becomes unlimited, as long as the target is on the same plane as the caster.</p>
