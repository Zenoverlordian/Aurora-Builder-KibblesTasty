        <description>
            <p>An Infusionsmith is, in some ways, perhaps the most quintessential type of Artificer. While other Artificers may delve into mechanics and tinkering, an Infusionsmith is an artificer that tinkers with magic itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">These are cutting edge of magical engineering, understanding the principle applications of magic. An Infusionsmith would have ground to stand on in calling a wizard an impulsive spell slinger, for these are the artificers that work their magic through careful and meticulous method, laying down magic they may not use for hours, or painstakingly crafting a long lasting enchantment.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Infusionsmith can be a magical swordsman, a wandslinger, or bookish supporting character with a bag full of tricks that never quite runs dry. Some will stand within a maelstrom of animated blades while others will plink away with a crossbow that seems unerringly accurate, but their common theme is using their prowess of infusion to make themselves formidable.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you can infuse a powerful armament to take into battle. At the end of a long rest, select one of the Infusions below. The infusion lasts until the end of your next long rest.</p>

            <p>You touch a melee weapon, causing it to spring to life. An animated weapon can be carried or stowed, but while readied, it floats beside you.

            <p class="indent">Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with your Blasting Rod, you can add your Intelligence modifier to damage dealt to that target.</p>
            <h5>Infused Weapon</h5>
            <p>You touch a weapon, enchanting its effectiveness. While this weapon is enchanted, you - and only you - have proficiency with it.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Infused Weapon can be wielded like a normal weapon, but gains the following property: you can apply your Intelligence modifier to the to attack and damage roll of the weapon where you usually apply your Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">If an Infused Weapon has a single damage die, and that damage die is less than a d12, the damage die of the Infused Weapon is increased (for example, a dagger's damage die would go from a d4 to a d6).</p>
