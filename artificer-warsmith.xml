        <description>
            <p>A Warsmith is an Inventor that has turned their wondrous talent of invention to a singular goal: making themselves a juggernaut of war. The reasons behind this could be benevolent or nefarious. Some Warsmiths seek to turn their invention into a machine of death and terror; others become the arbiter of justice and order, and others still perhaps merely seek to refine their craft in pursuit of pure innovation.</p>
            <p class="indent">Because few individuals would pursue such a wondrous invention without a driven purpose to their endeavor, Warsmiths tend to be Lawful, usually driven to their actions by a greater purpose they seek the power to accomplish, be it righting the wrongs of the world, or bringing it to heel beneath their ironshod boot.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you've attained the knowledge of forging and arcane tinkering sufficient to create a set of armor that augments and expands your abilities from a standard, non-magical, set of heavy armor using resources you've gathered. This process takes 8 hours to complete, as well as a place to forge and incorporates a Warplate Gauntlet (they do not require separate attunement).</p>
            <p class="indent">While wearing your armor, your Strength ability score increases by 2, and your maximum Strength ability score becomes 22.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can create a new set of armor by forging it from a set of gathered and purchased materials in a process that takes 2000 gold pieces and eight hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can create multiple sets of armor, but you can only be attuned to one of them at a given time, and you can only change which one you are attuned to during a long rest. If you create a new set of Warplate, you can apply a number of Upgrades equal to the value on the class table, applying each at the level you get it on the class table.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you create your armor, you can create a heavy plated Warplate, a magically enhanced set of gear, Warsuit, or you can integrate your changes directly into your body as an Integrated Armor.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your armor is Warplate or Integrated Armor, you gain the Powerful Build trait. Powerful Build means you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or left.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, if you are small, you become medium while wearing Warplate.</p>
