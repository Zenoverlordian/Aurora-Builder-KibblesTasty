            <p>Barbarians tap into primal powers, and a Barbarian of this path taps into one of the most ancient and primeval of them all: the power of dragons.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some say this path was born during the Dracorage by mortals tapping into the primal rage as it washed across the world, others say that only those with latent dragon blood coursing through them can walk this path. What all can agree on is the result is a being to be feared.</p>
            <p class="indent">As with most Barbarian, ones following this path tend toward Chaos, as they contain potent destructive power that paces at the edges of the cage, just waiting to be unleashed. Some, particularly those rare individuals that channel metallic colors, may be exceptions to this tendency.</p>
