        <description>
    <p>Wisps of purple smoke and dancing shadows rise from the ritual as the young human woman with strange magical markings tattooed across her hands whispers words in a language long forgotten, calling forth ancient powers.</p>
    <p class="indent">The woods creak and bend, black wings beating as raven alights on the outstretch hand of an ancient elf, her eyes as black as the raven's. Soft words are spoken, and the elf nods in agreement.</p>
    <p class="indent">A young orc lets out a bellowing roar and flames burst into a form taller than an ogre causing her enemies to flee. She holds up her spear and the flames pour from the roaring fire spirit to it, swirling about it, causing it to roar alight with searing magical flames.</p>
    <p class="indent">The mysterious halfling woman gives a knowing smile, her unseeing eyes focused on you. She knows what you've come for, and tosses a handful of incense into the fire; what it is she sees in there? Your fate? Your destiny? As she speaks, it is only in riddle.</p>
    <p class="indent">Occultists are those that follow the old ways, a path of ritual and wisdom long known yet oft forgotten. Rather than force magic to obey, they bind, twist, manipulate, and compromise with it. They follow ancient agreements and techniques to produce results that few fully understand, even those that use them, but they know it will work, for it always has.</p>
    <h4>ANCIENT TRADITIONS</h4>
    <p>Occultists are spell casters following legacies that go far back. While they may or may not be directly tutored or influence by another member of their tradition, their path to magic involves unearthing ancient secrets, old ways, and knowledge gleaned from spirits, ghosts, and elementals.</p>
    <p class="indent">The often personify aspects of their magic in ways that other casters find odd, coaxing and manipulating magic forces by ancient laws and bargains. Occultists tread between the arcane and the divine, not necessarily worshiping any god, but treating gods and spirits alike with cautious respect for their domains, asking for the what they take, and carefully giving thought to their actions.</p>
    <p class="indent">Each tradition that appears in the Occultist is an ancient legacy of magic, found deep within folklore and story. Every villager could tell you stories of Occultists and their traditions, and they are often seen in this context. Though villagers and the superstitious might fear them and their magic, they may be more likely to turn to them than a Wizard, for at least an Occultist makes sense to them, even if they are scared by their powers.</p>
    <h4>SPIRITUAL MAGIC</h4>
    <p>A common thread of the magic wilded by the Occultist is the spiritual connection of it; the demi-divine nature of magic that taps into the weave of magic oft through the intermediaries of the power of gods, spirits, elementals, and more. An Occultist is fundamentally tied into the greater magical world, being neither a source of magic nor an academic researcher of it, but wielding it through intuition, cunning, and tradition.</p>
    <p class="indent">Frequently an Occultist may call upon their magic through the mediums of spirits quite directly, even having names for the spirits it calls about to bring about certain magical effects; the verbal component of an Occultist spell might be the spirit they call upon to work the effect they wish, an invocation of their ancient bargain, or words in a language that binds or persuades.</p>
    <h4>CREATING AN OCCULTIST</h4>
    <p>When creating an Occultist, the most important decision will be what Tradition you follow. Each Tradition of an Occultist is distinct with divergent flavor and calling upon a different aspect of folklore. Do you embody the associations or defy them? What led you to this path? Did you uncover your tradition on your own or were you taught by another?</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
    <p>You can make an Occultist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the poison spray and produce flame cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells burning hands, cause fear, cure wounds, and tasha's hideous laughter.</p>

        <description>
            <p>As a practioner of occult magic, you have inherited and developed techniques to manipulate reality through mediums of rituals, spirits, elements, and more. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Occultist spell list.</p>
            <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Occultist spell list. You learn additional Occultist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Occultist table.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The Occultist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Occultist spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell witchbolt and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast witchbolt using either slot.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
            <p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the Occultist spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Occultist table shows when you learn more Occultist spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Occultist spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Occultist spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Occultist spells. Your magic comes from a practitioners knowledge of traditional, ritual, and the way things work learned through experience, care and cunning. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Occultist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
            <p>You can cast any Occultist spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
            <p>You can use an occult fetish as a spellcasting focus for your Occultist spells.</p>

            <p>An oracle is an occultists whose power comes to them from their connection to fate; bound and empowered oracles carry some piece of divine mystery within them, tied to an aspect of destiny and fate.

The object has the following stats: HP: 20, AC: 18, Str: 4, Dex: 18. The object has an attack modifier equal to your spell attack modifier. If the object is a weapon, it deals damage equal to the weapon's damage dice + your Wisdom modifier on hit dealing that weapons damage type, otherwise it deals 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier bludgeoning damage on hit.</p>

You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>

The shadow has no legendary actions, legendary resistance, and cannot cast spells. The shadow creature has hit points equal to half the target's hit points, and looks like mirrored version of the creature it was summoned from formed from inky black smoke. The creature is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources while in darkness. The creature is vulnerable to all damage while in bright light, and always vulnerable to fire, lightning, and radiant damage. If the shadow is killed, the target creature it was summoned from casts no shadows for the next 8 hours.</p>

            <p>A vertical column of spiders begins to rain down in 20 foot radius, 40 foot high cylinder, centered on a location you specify. A Swarm of Spiders (Monster Manual, pg 334) descends onto each creature within the cylinder when the spell is cast.</p>
            <p class="indent">This swarm is considered to be climbing on the target creature and moves with it, even if they leave the affected area, and takes its turn immediately after that creature's turn. A creature can make use its action to attempt to get it off, making a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the spell save DC of the caster.</p>
            <p class="indent">A swarm will attack the creature it fell on if it can, or move to chase it if it has been knocked off of it. Any spiders that remain when the spell ends disappear.</p>

            <p class="indent">The spirit will follow you and cannot stray more than 5 feet from you. You can choose to release it early, dismissing it back from whence it came.</p>

            <p>You cast a curse targeting two individuals. Both targets must make a Charisma saving throw (which they can choose to fail). If both targets fail their saving throws, for the duration of the spell their souls are swapped. A soul controls the body it inhabits. It gains any ability score or action the body had (besides legendary actions or legendary resistance), but retains its own spell casting (if it has the spellcasting, innate or otherwise), and has disadvantage on all attack rolls and strength, dexterity, and constitution saving throws for 1d4 turns after swapping bodies.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of a swapped creatures turn, it can choose to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save. It its CR (or character level if it has no CR) is higher than the body of the creature it is, it has advantage on the save.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature dies while while its soul is swapped, the souls return to their original bodies. If a soul was in a dying creature that returns to a living body, that creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage.</p>

            <p>You target a point and call forth tendrils, twisted vines, and gnarled roots of dark energy that erupt from the ground in a 60 foot radius. All creatures of your choice must make a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained as the shadowy plant tendrils grasp and drain the life from it.</p>
            <p class="indent">At start of a creature's turn, if it is restrained by the spell, it takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage, and 2d10 necrotic damage. Each time a creature takes necrotic damage from this spell, the caster regains 1d4 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature restrained by the tendrils can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A tendril can be destroyed, freeing a creature from its grasp. They have an AC of 10, 20 hit point, and are immune to all damage besides radiant and fire. Spells that deal radiant or fire damage to creatures in an area of effect also affect tendrils in that area.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures that end their turn within the radius while not restrained must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by the tendrils.</p>

The target takes 4d10 necrotic damage on a failed save and becomes withered until the start of your next turn, or half as much on a successful one and does not become withered.
