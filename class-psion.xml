        <description>
            <p>A large orc is flung across the room, smashing through tables and chairs before hitting the wall with a thunderous crash, collapsing dazed. A human, her eyes still glowing with unearthly power, tosses a few extra coins on the bar. "Sorry for the mess. If he wakes up, tell him to try picking on someone his own size next time".</p>
            <p class="indent">The prisoner's expression turns from  defiant to puzzled as the interrogator asks no questions, merely stares at them silently. His puzzled expression turns worried as he finds himself, unbidden, recalling where he stashed the loot. "Under the stables behind the Rusty Hook Inn" the interrogator finally speaks, as the thief's expression becomes terrified.</p>
            <p class="indent">"Ain't you... cold or somethin'?" the dwarf asks the elf as they trudge through the snow, eying her simple robe and bare feet. "I just think 'warm'" the elf replies with a distracted air. The dwarf snorts, a puff of chilled air. Typical elf nonsense. Except... they haven't frozen to death yet. "Say... could you think some 'warm' this way?" the dwarf asks hopefully. To the dwarfs surprise, the chill of the snow fades away completely "that's downright creepy... hey don't stop now! Was jus' sayin' it was creepy."</p>
            <p class="indent">Psions are those who have tapped into a special otherworldly force, with the ability to actualize the power of their mind to accomplish impossible feats. Reading minds, lifting vast weights, and transcending physical limitations, they tend to inspire awe and terror in equal measure.</p>
            <p class="indent">The exact nature of what is Psionic power might be a question answered in your setting, or it might not be. Most view Psionic power as coming from within, though other answers exist - anything from the leaking power of the Far Realm, to an alternate way to express magic, to an actualization of an individual's will upon the world.</p>
            <h4>POWERFUL MINDS</h4>
            <p>Since a psion's weapon is their mind, they are always a careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep their thoughts and emotions in check, lest their powers run amok. This leads to many of them developing odd behaviors or mannerisms to help them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric to an outside observer.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider how your psion keeps their powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday life. How reading minds may affect their body language or habits. Do they add wood to the campfire from the comfort of their bedroll, or do they restrain themselves from using their power for trivial matters lest they slip up?</p>
            <h4>MISUNDERSTOOD POWER</h4>
            <p>In a world of widespread magic, many will assume a Psion to be a type of Sorcerer or Wizard, mistaking their powers for the common applications of magic. The common villager keeps only one mental category for the supernatural and creepy people that bend reality to their will. But even among magic users, a Psion's powers will frequently be found unnerving.</p>
            <p class="indent">It is often those who do understand magic that finds a Psion’s abilities the most aberrant. A force that intersects the magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A Psion</h4>
            <p>When creating a Psion, consider your character's background. How did you become a Psion? Were you born with latent powers? Or did something happen to you granting your powers? Or did you intentionally train yourself through rigorous mental exercise to leverage them? Consider how developing a rare and mysterious power would have affected your interactions with people.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider what your purpose is with your newfound powers, or how you plan to use your powers. Do you intend to be taken for a Wizard casting magic, or are you freely open about being of a... different nature?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Psion quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the Acolyte, Far Traveler or Hermit background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <p>At 1st level, you pick the archetype of Psion you embody, choosing from Awakened, Unleashed, Transcended, or Shaper, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>

            <h5>PSIONIC DISCIPLINES</h5>
            <p>You are granted access to a psionic discipline (such as Telepathy or Telekinesis) by your chosen archetype. A psionic discipline comes with a passive feature that expands your character's capabilities and an active psionic power that can be modified and empowered with Psi Points. Additionally you can use your discipline in more detailed applications to recreate the effect of certain spells, listed at the end of the discipline description. At 3rd level you can select a second discipline, and 18th level you can select a 3rd discipline.</p>
            <p class="indent">Psionic powers are suppressed by anti-magic field and can be dispelled with dispel magic, but are only affected by counterspell if recreating the effect of a spell. Any check required to dispel magic, counterspell or identify a spell being cast with Psionics is made at disadvantage unless the caster also has the Psionics feature. The spell detect magic will detect the usage of psionics, but not their nature - it will show up as a mysterious untyped power, even if being used to generate the effect of a spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">When recreating a spell through a Psionic effect (using a Psionic discipline to cast the spell) the spell has no Material or Verbal components, but using any psionic ability requires Somatic components and causes the Psion to vibrantly glow with the otherworldly psionic energies they are controlling.</p>
            <h5>PSI POINTS</h5>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain access to Psi Points used to fuel psionic discipline powers and effects. You have a number of Psi Points equal to your Psion level, and regain all spent points after completing a short or long rest. You can spend a number of Psi Points equal to half your Psion level (rounded up) at a time (for example, at level 5, you can spend 3 psi points on psionic power or cast a spell with a cost of 3 psi points).</p>
            <h5>PSIONIC ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Psionic powers, psionic talents, and spells gained through this class use your Psionic ability.</p>

At higher level, you gain more innate abilities of your choice that can be used in this way: one 7th level spell at 13th level, one 8th level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level.

When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack; so long as it does not move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack, on a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage.</p>

Commands require no action, but you cannot exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.</p>
            <p><strong>Strike</strong> (2 psi point): The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).</p>
            <p><strong>Relocate</strong> (1 psi point): The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.</p>
            <p><strong>Solidify</strong> (1 psi point): You construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is not in another creatures space. It has an armor class of 16, and hit points of your Intelligence modifier + your Psion level. The construct ethereal again if it drops to zero hit points.</p>
            <p><strong>Grab</strong> (1 psi point): Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained. At the end of the creatures turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends of the construct becomes ethereal again.</p>
            <p><strong>Grow</strong> (1 psi points): Your construct by a size, and its damage increased by one die. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn unless you use Sustain. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8).</p>
            <p><strong>Replicate</strong> (3 psi points): You use Relocate, but the original does not disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another construct and control both with the same action (commands only affect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.</p>
            <p><strong>Sustain</strong> (1+ psi point): At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command an additional round. This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining solidify refreshes the construct's hit points to its maximum.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You can use your mind to create a burst of elemental power, blasting a target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">For each die of cold damage dealt, the creature's movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn, for each die of fire damage dealt by the original attack, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of its next turn, and for each die of lightning damage dealt, an arc of lightning strikes another creature of your choice within 20 feet, dealing 1d4 lightning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can spend Psi Points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.</p>
            <p><strong>Amplified</strong> (1+ psi points): The target takes an additional 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Lasting</strong> (1 psi point): Your Elemental Blast leaves a 5 foot radius sphere of devastating behind where it strikes until the start of your next turn. Creatures that enter this zone for the first time or end their turn in it must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the secondary effects (slow, burn, arc) of the blast as if they had been hit by it.</p>
            <p><strong>Massive</strong> (1-3 psi points): You unleash a massive blast; rather than making an attack roll, all creatures within a 15 foot cone must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On failure, they take the effect as if hit by the Elemental Blast. The size of the cone is doubled for each point up to 3 spent (2 points for 30 foot, 3 points for 60 foot).</p>
            <p><strong>Overcharged</strong> (0 psi point): You take 1d4 force damage and do not add your Proficiency modifier from the attack or Spell Save DC for your Elemental Blast, but increase the damage it deals by twice your Proficiency modifier.</p>

            <p>An Awakened Mind is a Psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the Far Realm in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.</p>
            <p class="indent">An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest - telepathy - is one of the most feared and shunned abilities.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Awakened can be either empathetic or cruel, good or evil. Knowing what is on the minds of others affects people in different ways, driving some away from society as they see its true face, while others feel drawn to help the problems only they can see.</p>

            <p>You unleash a beam of pure energy, selecting cold, fire, force, or lightning energy and blasting it outward in a line that is 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that persists at the start of your next turn.

            <p>You manipulate the nature of your body with magic temporarily giving it new properties. You can select three of the following properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your body becomes malleable and amorphous. You have advantage on saves and checks against grapples and the restrained condition, you do not suffer disadvantage from squeezing into smaller spaces, and you can squeeze through openings two sizes smaller than you.</li>
                <li>You grow one additional appendage. This appendage serves as an arm and a hand, though it can take the shape of an arm, tentacle, or similar appendage.</li>
                <li>You extend the length of your limbs, giving you a 10 foot reach on melee attacks, touch spells, and object interactions.</li>
                <li>Your flesh hardens, your base AC becomes 14 + your dexterity modifier if it is not already higher.</li>
                <li>You grow more resilient, adapting against one external threat. You gain advantage on one type of saving throw of your choice.</li>
                <li>You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</li>
                <li>Your body grows ablative armor. You gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier at the start of each of your turns.</li>
                <li>You can grow one size larger or smaller.</li>
                <li>You sprout wings. You gain a flying speed of 30 feet.</li>
                <li>You grow a natural weapon; this weapon can have the statistics of any martial melee weapon and takes on a form vaguely reminiscent of it without the thrown property. You have proficiency with this weapon, and are considered holding it. You can use your spellcasting modifier in place of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls with this natural weapon. The natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">For the duration of the spell, you can use an action to change one or all of the properties, losing the benefits of your previously selected properties and gaining the benefits of the new selected properties.</p>
