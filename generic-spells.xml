            <p>You condense wind into a razor sharp blast that shreds a 30 foot long 5 feet wide line. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 slashing damage on a failed save and half as much on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create an additional line of effect. A creature in the area of more than one slash is affected only once</p>

        <description>
            <p>You create a whirling sphere of air around a target that causes them to struggle to breathe. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On failure, the target loses 5d8 hit points due to lack of air, has disadvantage on all ability checks, and cannot speak. On success, the target takes half as damage and suffers no other effects. If a target fails a saving throw against this ability on their turn 3 turns in a row, they become incapacitated until they pass a save against this spell or do not have to make one since the end of their last turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">For the duration, as an action, you can force the creation to make a saving throw against the ability again.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that does not breath the atmosphere is unaffected by this spell.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A whirling tornado erupts filling a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any creature that starts its turn within the tornado must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away and 40 feet up. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can move the tornado up to 30 feet in any direction. Any ranged weapon attack against a target within 20 feet of the tornado has disadvantage, and any ranged attack that passes through it automatically misses.</p>
