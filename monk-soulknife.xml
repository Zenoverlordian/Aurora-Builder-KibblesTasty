            <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you've learned to focus your ki into a psionic blade. As a bonus action, you can create a blade of pure scintillating psionic energy. The blade you create this way most typically takes the form of a knife-like blade projecting from your fist, but you can shape it however you choose. You can choose to create multiple blades, but any blade you are not holding vanishes at the end of your turn and must be resummoned.</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless of the form it takes, the weapon is a monk weapon for you, deals 1d8 psychic damage, and has the light, finesse, and thrown(20/60) properties.</p>
