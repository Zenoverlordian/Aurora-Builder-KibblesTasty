        <description>
            <p>A Shaper is a Psion that specializes in the materialization of their imagination, projecting it out into the world. No mere conjurers borrowing the powers of other planes, a Shaper manifests things from nothing but their own mind, weaving their creations into existence through the exertion of raw psionic power and imagination.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Shaper's mind is a tool of nearly unrivaled power possessing both boundless creativity and inexorable will, but if that will is overrun, the world would do well to fear a Shaper's nightmares.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 1st level, when you conjure your Astral Construct, you can apply one of the following powers to it:</p>
            <p><strong>Devastating Weapons</strong> You imagine more deadly armaments - from a greatsword to vicious fangs - causing your Astral Construct to grow more deadly. The Astral Construct's damage becomes 1d12.</p>
            <p><strong>Psionic Conduit</strong> You can use your Psionic powers through your Astral Construct, as if you were where it is.</p>
            <p><strong>Vivid Existence</strong> Your Astral Construct fully materializes and automatically uses Solidify at the start of its turn without requiring a command to do so.</p>
