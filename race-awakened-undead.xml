        <description>
            <p>You are the skeletal remains of what once was a living creature; you are both the power that animates these remains and bound to remains themselves. The source of your second life varies - perhaps risen as a mindless undead by a necromancer you eventually awakened sentience, perhaps you are fey spirit that inhabited the bones and got stuck, or perhaps you fiendish creature bound to this form to walk the material plane - there are many options for how you ended up in this predicament, but beware, your new life is as fragile as any mortal, and you can die as they do.</p>
            <p class="indent">This is a unique and flexible race where your exact nature depends on several factors of your circumstance and it presents unique traits and challenges, including some large conveniences and inconveniences that can lead to nonstandard circumstances, particularly around healing.</p>
            <h4>Awakened Undead Traits</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> As an undead, you have increased resilience. Your Constitution score and one other ability score of choice increase by 1. You gain one additional ability score increase from the type of Remains selected in your subrace choice.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Awakened undead are effectively ageless. Their age can be measured from when they have awakened, but they do not change with age beyond their lived experience from that point.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> While typical undead are nearly universally evil due to the negative energy that animates them, there are other sources of undead animation that run a broader range of possibilities. Regardless of your animating force, what differentiates an Awakened Undead is awareness and control, and as such they can freely choose their alignment. Some will still choose evil, but others find a new path upon awakening.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Undead are typically animated from medium sized humanoid corpses, and have sizes based on the creature they once were. Your size is Medium unless otherwise specified by your Remains type.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Due to your unique nature sight. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> Your creature type is undead, rather than humanoid. As a result of being undead, you have the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
                <li>You are immune to disease.</li>
                <li>You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Magical Vitality.</em></strong> As you are powered by magic, your vitality can be restored by magical power. Any creature (including you) with access to spell slots can expend a spell slot as with range of touch as an action to restore 1d4 + their spell casting modifier hit points per level of the spell slot to you, donating their magical power to your vitality. Whenever you are healed in this fashion, you can expend hit dice (rolling them as normal) equal to the spell slot level used to regain additional hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can be returned to life with the animate dead spell, which has the effects of revivify when cast targeting only you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Reassembly.</em></strong> Your body can be assembled if pieces are broken off. A lost limb can be reattached over a short rest while spending 1 or more hit dice as long as the limb is in your possession, and your corpse counts as intact if all pieces of it can be found and assembled for resurrection spells.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Turn Resistance.</em></strong> Due to your awakened nature, you have advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Antimagic Susceptibility.</em></strong> As a magically alive force, you are weakened while in the area of an antimagic field. At the start of each turn you spend it, must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On failure, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks, and your speed is halved. If you fail by 5 or more, you are stunned until the end of your turn. If you are the target of dispel magic, you must succeed a Charisma saving throw against the caster's spell save DC (even if the caster is an allied creature). On failure, you are stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Awakened Undead are extremely varied by their nature, and consequently create their subrace in a unique way by selecting two values: their remains, and their animating force. Their remains indicate what sort of corpse you are animating, and your the animating force dictates what sort of force is driving the animation.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your selection of remains gives you an ability score (listed in the table below) which is increased by one, and a feature that is defined below. Your animating force gives a language known as well as a feature (also defined below). If the language is listed as "matching remains" it means the language of the type of corpse you are animating spoke in life (for example, for an elf corpse, Elvish).</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common.</p>

            <p>You've mastered a second power of Awakening, gaining control of a greater set of powers over your condition. This can be from infusing yourself with energy of that source, or simply learning to imitate the powers natural to that source (for example, a returned spirit may find themselves mastering the powers of a Wandering Spirit after getting used to the condition). You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase you Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
                <li>Select an additional option from the Animating Force table, gaining its features.</li>

            <p>You're life and your body are not one in the same anymore, and the destruction of one need not lead to the other. You can connect an item to your soul; this item must absorb 1 soul or 3rd level (or higher) spell slot a week to be active (a creature can willingly expend a spell slot to power the item, expending it as normal as if casting a spell). If you die while it is active and on the same plane as you, your body crumbles to dust and your body reforms after 1d10 hours within 5 feet of the soulbound item, returning to life with 1 hit point.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, your remains become further antithetical to life. When you make an attack with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or spell with the range of touch, on hit you can force the target creature to pass a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Charisma or Constitution modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus becomes Paralyzed until the start of their next turn. Once you do attempt to use paralyzing touch, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
