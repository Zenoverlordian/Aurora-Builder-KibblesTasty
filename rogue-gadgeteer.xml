            <p>Swinging from a grappling hook before dropping a smoke bomb, rigging a stubborn lock to blow, or rejiggering traps to spring on those that set them, the Gadgeteer lives by fast paced innovation and thinking outside the box on the fly... sometimes literally.</p>
            <p class="indent">Specializing tools that let themselves in and out of trouble, they don't fight fair, relying on things that go "boom", "zap" or "whirr". They live on the edge of their own explosions, though often rewriting the story in later retellings that they doffed their darkened goggles as they walked away slowly, omitting the singed seat of their trousers and yelping.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you've mastered both the creation and use of your most important gadget, the grappling hook. As an action or with the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or Smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it (automatically succeeding against objects that are not being worn or carried unless the DM sets a difficulty for a particularly complicated scenario).</p>

Attacks of opportunity generated by this movement have disadvantage.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you gain access to an important arsenal of things that explode. Forgoing some subtlety for firepower, you gain the following options:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Smoke Bomb.</em></strong> As an action, you can use this to cast fog cloud centered on yourself without expending a spell slot. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and does not require concentration. When you cast fog cloud In this way, you can set the radius at 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.</p>
